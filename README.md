## 🧠 Overview  
**Day 07** of my #100Days100Projects challenge — where lists take the spotlight!  
Today’s focus was on mastering **Python Lists**: creating, accessing, modifying, and iterating over them.  

With these concepts, I built an interactive **Shopping List CLI App** that allows users to manage their daily shopping items dynamically.

## 🎯 Today’s Project Spotlight: Shopping List CLI App 🛒

An interactive menu-driven app where users can manage their shopping list: add, view, remove, or clear items — all in real time.

🔧 Features:
- Add items dynamically  
- Remove items by name or position  
- View the full list with numbering  
- Clear the entire shopping list  
- Exit the app gracefully  

💡 A fun way to connect list operations with a practical everyday example!
