# Day07_100Days100Projects
This repository is Day 07 of my #100Days100Projects challenge, focusing on Python Lists. It includes scripts for list creation, operations, and methods, along with a practical Shopping List CLI App that lets users add, view, remove, and clear items interactively. A simple, real-world project to strengthen list manipulation skills in Python.
